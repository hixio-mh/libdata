# NGN Utility Library

While this JavaScript library is maintained primarily by and for NGN, it is a standalone "cross-runtime" library (will work without NGN). 

The library consists of common functions for managing primitive and low level elements of JavaScript (objects, arrays, booleans, etc).

## Usage

### Via CDN (Browser/Deno)

```javascript
import utils from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@ngnjs/libdata'

console.log(utils)
```

### Node

`npm i ngn @ngnjs/libdata -S`

```javascript
import utils from '@ngnjs/libdata'
console.log(utils)
```
